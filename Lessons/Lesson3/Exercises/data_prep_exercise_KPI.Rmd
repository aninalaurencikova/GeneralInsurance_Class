Data preparation for lesson 2 (KPI's, searching for bad looking portfolios)
================

In the lesson theory we learned what is underwriting result. Now we will have a look at the same data as we did earlier and will explore the portfolios and how well they did in terms of underwriting result.

``` r
# load libraries
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# load data
dt_KPI_raw <- read.csv("./Data/lesson2_KPI.csv")
```

### Loss and expense ratios, underwriting result

#### Is there even better way how to look at portfolios? Previously we spoke about performance of portfolios in absolute numbers.

> Can you create something similar as we did but using KPIs representing relative values?

##### How could be relative performance in terms of losses defined?

``` r
# your code
```

##### How would you calculate underwriting result of the business units in the data?

``` r
# your code
```

##### Which unit looks good and which looks bad in terms of underwriting result?

``` r
# your code
```

Reflection  - write a short comment to your notes in repository on what do you think is the best and the worst Unit performer based on what you have learned recently. Feel free to do more data exploration.
